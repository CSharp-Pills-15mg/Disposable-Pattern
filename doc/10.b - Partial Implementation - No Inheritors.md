# 10.b - No Inheritors

Sometimes, we know for suer that the class we create will not be inherited. If this is the case, the disposable implementation is simplified.

### The main class

In this case, we have the following changes:

- The class should be markes as `sealed` to ensure that no other class derives from it.
- The internal `Dispose(bool)` can be made `private` and no `virtual` is needed becasue it will not be overwritten.

```csharp
internal sealed class MyBusiness : IDisposable
{
    private bool isDisposed;
    private IntPtr pointer;
    private FileStream fileStream;
    
    public MyBusiness()
    {
        pointer = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(1024);
        fileStream = File.OpenWrite("c:\\temp\\file.txt");
    }
    
    public void DoSomeWork()
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            throw new ObjectDisposedException();
        
        // ...
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
    
    private void Dispose(bool isDisposing)
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            return;
        
        Marshal.FreeHGlobal(pointer);
        
        if (isDisposing)
        {
            fileStream.Dispose();
        }
        
        isDisposed = true;
    }
    
    ~MyBusiness()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```

### The usage of the main class

This is the way how the class is instantiated and used.

```csharp
internal static void Main()
{
    while (true)
    {
        using MyBusiness myBusiness = new();
        
        myBusiness.DoSomeOtherWork();
        
        DoSomethingElse();
    }
}

internal static DoSometingElse()
{
    // Sometimes it may throw.    
    if (DateTime.Now.Ticks % 2 == 0)
        throw new Exception("Something went terribly wrong.");
}
```
