# 10.a - No Unmanaged Code

In most of the real life cases, we will not manually allocate unmanaged memory. In most of these situations our classes will contain other managed objects, which already implement the `IDisposable` pattern. This will simplify the needed implementation.

## The class

If the class does not contain unmanaged memory (pointers) that need to be released, then we may drop the finalizer.

The finalizer, by calling the internal `Dispose(false)` with `false` parameter it, actually, only releases the unmanaged resources. The disposable members are not diposed. We are already in the finalization process, Garbage Collector will take care of all the objects that correctly implement the disposable pattern.

The public `Dispose()` must still suppress the finalization process, because a derived class might add its own finalizer.

```csharp
internal class MyBusiness : IDisposable
{
    private bool isDisposed;
    private FileStream fileStream;
    
    public MyBusiness()
    {
        fileStream = File.OpenWrite("c:\\temp\\file.txt");
    }
    
    public void DoSomeWork()
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            throw new ObjectDisposedException();
        
        // ...
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
    
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool isDisposing)
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            return;
        
        if (isDisposing)
        {
            fileStream.Dispose();
        }
        
        isDisposed = true;
    }
}
```

## The derived class

The derived class may or may not contain unmanaged memory. The following example is the one that does not contain unmanaged memeory.

```csharp
internal class OtherBusiness : MyBusiness
{
    private bool isDisposed;
    private Font font;
    
    public MyBusiness()
    {
        font = new Font();
    }
    
    public void DoSomeOtherWork()
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            throw new ObjectDisposedException();
        
        // Use the pointer and the font here.
        // ...
    }
    
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            return;
        
        if (isDisposing)
        {
            font.Dispose();
        }
        
        isDisposed = true;
        
        base.Dispose(isDisposing);        
    }
}
```
