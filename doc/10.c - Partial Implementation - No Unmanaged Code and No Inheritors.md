# 10.c - No Unmanaged Code and No Inheritors

If there are no unmanaged resources and no inheritors, the implementation is simplified considerably.

### The main class

- The main class is marked as `sealed` to ensure that no inheritors will be created.
- The finalizer can be removed, becasue we have no unmanaged code.
- The public `Dispose()` and private `Dispose(bool)` can be merged into one method. The parameter can be removedl it will alwais have the value `true`.

```csharp
internal sealed class MyBusiness : IDisposable
{
    private bool isDisposed;
    private FileStream fileStream;
    
    public MyBusiness()
    {
        fileStream = File.OpenWrite("c:\\temp\\file.txt");
    }
    
    public void DoSomeWork()
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            throw new ObjectDisposedException();
        
        // ...
    }
    
    public void Dispose()
    {
        if (isDisposed)
            return;
        
        fileStream.Dispose();
        
        isDisposed = true;
    }
}
```

### The usage of the main class

This is the way how the class is instantiated and used.

```csharp
internal static void Main()
{
    while (true)
    {
        using MyBusiness myBusiness = new();
        
        myBusiness.DoSomeWork();
        
        DoSomethingElse();
    }
}

internal static DoSometingElse()
{
    // Sometimes it may throw.    
    if (DateTime.Now.Ticks % 2 == 0)
        throw new Exception("Something went terribly wrong.");
}
```
